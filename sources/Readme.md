# Project 1: Movie Trailer Website 

## How to run the application (OSX)

1. Unzip the archive

2. Open folder that contains the sources in Terminal.app

3. Execute following:

		python movies_website.py


## Notes

I modified the fresh_tomatoes.py file so it could show the imdb link next to the movie's title.
